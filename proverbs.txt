He who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not ask remains a fool forever
If God lived on earth, people would break his windows
Speak the truth, but leave immediately after
Once the game is over, the King and the pawn go back in the same box
Good habits result from resisting temptation
If the wind will not serve, take to the oars
What may be done at any time will be done at no time
A handful of patience is worth more than a bushel of brains
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor man perfected without trials
Charity sees the need not the cause
Who begins too much accomplishes little
When the character of a man is not clear to you, look at his friends
Never criticize a man until you've walked a mile in his shoes
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime
Fall seven times, stand up eight
Do not remove a fly from your friend's forehead with a hatchet
When you have given nothing, ask for nothing
Whoever gossips to you will gossip about you
When you drink the water, remember the spring
Be not afraid of growing slowly, be afraid only of standing still
Two wrongs don't make a right
The pen is mightier than the sword
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
No man is an island
Fortune favors the bold
People who live in glass houses should not throw stones
Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst
Better late than never
Birds of a feather flock together
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
A picture is worth a thousand words
There's no such thing as a free lunch
There's no place like home
The early bird catches the worm
Never look a gift horse in the mouth
You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs
God helps those who help themselves
You can't always get what you want
Cleanliness is next to godliness
A watched pot never boils
Beggars can't be choosers
Actions speak louder than words
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
Practice makes perfect
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
After the feast comes the reckoning
All that glitters is not gold
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree
Bad news travels fast
Barking dogs seldom bite
Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder
Beggars can't be choosers
The best things in life are free
Better a live coward than a dead hero
Better late than never
Better safe than sorry
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Blood is thicker than water
Charity begins at home
Clothes do not make the man
Curiosity killed the cat
Do as I say, not as I do
Don't bite off more than you can chew
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Don't count your chickens before they're hatched
Don't cry over spilled milk
Don't judge a book by its cover
Don't judge a man until you've walked in his boots
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Don't put off for tomorrow what you can do today
Don't put the cart before the horse
Familiarity breeds contempt
The first step is always the hardest
A fool and his money are soon parted
Forewarned is forearmed
A friend in need is a friend indeed
A friend who shares is a friend who cares
Good things come in small packages
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence
Haste makes waste
He who hesitates is lost
He who laughs last, laughs best
Hindsight is better than foresight
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again
If you can't beat them, join them
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
In unity there is strength
It never rains but it pours
It takes two to tango
Leave well enough alone
A leopard cannot change its spots
Lightning never strikes twice in the same place
Look before you leap
Love is blind
Love makes the world go round
Make hay while the sun shines
Man does not live by bread alone
A man is known by the company he keeps
Might makes right
Misery loves company
A miss is as good as a mile
Money does not grow on trees
Necessity is the mother of invention
No news is good news
Be not afraid of growing slowly, be afraid only of standing still
No pain, no gain
Nothing hurts like the truth
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Old habits die hard
One good turn deserves another
One man's gravy is another man's poison
One swallow does not a summer make
The pen is mightier than the sword
Possession is nine-tenths of the law
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
Rome wasn't built in a day
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak
The squeaking wheel gets the oil
Strike while the iron is hot
There is no honor among thieves
There's more than one way to skin a cat
There's no fool like an old fool
There's no place like home
Too many chiefs, not enough Indians
Two heads are better than one
Two's company, but three's a crowd
Variety is the spice of life
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach
When the cat's away, the mice play
Where there's smoke, there's fire
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink
You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You have to take the good with the bad
You reap what you sow
You're never too old to learn
A dog won't forsake his master because of his poverty, a son never deserts his mother for her homely appearance
An inch of time is an inch of gold but you can't buy that inch of time with an inch of gold
If you have never done anything evil, you should not be worrying about devils knocking at your door
You think you lost your horse? Who knows, he may bring a whole herd back to you someday
To attract good fortune, spend a new coin on an old friend, share an old pleasure with a new friend, and lift up the heart of a true friend by writing his name on the wings of a dragon
Even a hare will bite when it is cornered
One monk shoulders water by himself; two can still share the labor among them. When it comes to three, they have to go thirsty
A bird that you set free may be caught again, but a word that escapes your lips will not return
A mother understands what a child does not say
As you teach, you learn
First mend yourself, and then mend others
He that can't endure the bad, will not live to see the good
Not to have felt pain is not to have been human
What you don't see with your eyes, don't invent with your mouth
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
Easy come, easy go
All good things must come to an end
One man's trash is another man's treasure
There's no time like the present
A penny saved is a penny earned
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link
Honesty is the best policy
When one door shuts, another opens
Where there's a will, there's a way
Out of sight, out of mind
The forbidden fruit is the sweetest
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill
Don't cross a bridge until you come to it
Beauty is only skin deep
A bad workman always blames his tools
All's well that ends well
