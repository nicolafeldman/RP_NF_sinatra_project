He who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not ask remains a fool forever
If God lived on earth, people would break his windows
Speak the truth, but leave immediately after
Once the game is over, the King and the pawn go back in the same box
Good habits result from resisting temptation
If the wind will not serve, take to the oars
What may be done at any time will be done at no time
A handful of patience is worth more than a bushel of brains
The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor man perfected without trials
Charity sees the need not the cause
Who begins too much accomplishes little
When the character of a man is not clear to you, look at his friends
Never criticize a man until you've walked a mile in his shoes
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime
Fall seven times, stand up eight
Do not remove a fly from your friend's forehead with a hatchet
When you have given nothing, ask for nothing
Whoever gossips to you will gossip about you
When you drink the water, remember the spring
Be not afraid of growing slowly, be afraid only of standing still
Two wrongs don't make a right
The pen is mightier than the sword
When in Rome, do as the Romans
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
No man is an island
Fortune favors the bold
People who live in glass houses should not throw stones
Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst
Better late than never
Birds of a feather flock together
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
A picture is worth a thousand words
There's no such thing as a free lunch
There's no place like home
The early bird catches the worm
Never look a gift horse in the mouth
You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs
God helps those who help themselves
You can't always get what you want
Cleanliness is next to godliness
A watched pot never boils
Beggars can't be choosers
Actions speak louder than words
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
Practice makes perfect
Too many cooks spoil the broth
